# Algorithm Description

## Introduction

This algorithm performs sorting using the insertion sort technique. It takes user input for the size of the array and its elements, sorts the array using insertion sort, and then displays the sorted array.

## Procedures

### 1. Inputs

The `Inputs` procedure takes user input for each element of the array and populates the array.

### 2. Sorting

The `Sorting` procedure implements the insertion sort algorithm to sort the array.

### 3. DisplayOutputs

The `DisplayOutputs` procedure displays the sorted array.

## Algorithm Steps

1. Read the size of the array from the user and call the `Inputs` procedure to populate the array.
2. Call the `Sorting` procedure to sort the array using insertion sort.
3. Call the `DisplayOutputs` procedure to display the sorted array.

## Usage

To use this algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Compile and run the program.
2. Enter a valid size for the array (positive and less than 100).
3. Enter the elements of the array one by one.
4. The program will display the sorted array.
